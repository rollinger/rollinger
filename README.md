Hi, Iâ€™m @rollinger ðŸ‘‹ a Django Full Stack Developer and Creative Explorer of futuristic ideas that can transform our lives. Currently experimenting with C/C++ at 42 Wolfsburg.

I love developing Web Applications with Django, a powerful Python Framework, and translate ideas into code and nice software. I specialize in the Django Backend, REST Endpoints and server integrations. I worked with clients from Australia to Europe and Canada. See my GitHub for various public, open projects I have been working on.

I am a experienced Django Full Stack Developer with a focus on backend development, server optimization, deployment chain, testing and API development.

â˜… Over 12 years professional experience in Full Stack Django Development. 
â˜… Developing on latest versions (Dj/Py), with code black, PEP-8 and testing.
â˜… GIT and Linux Serves are my second home.
â˜… I am no seasoned designer, yet I can implement the frontend too, making a clean structure for a designer to continue on.
â˜… Currently learning and adding Vue.js to my stack.
â˜… I speak, write, code and work in english, german and spanish with ease. 
â˜… I love travel and to learn new cultures and ways of life.
