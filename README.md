Hi, Iâ€™m @rollinger ðŸ‘‹ a Django Full Stack Developer and Creative Explorer of futuristic ideas.

As an experienced full stack Django developer, I have a passion for turning ideas into code and building powerful web applications using the Django framework. My expertise lies in backend development, including server optimization, deployment chain, testing and API development. I have a strong background in developing REST endpoints and server integrations, and I am always eager to take on new and challenging projects. 

You can see a subset of my public and open projects on my GitHub. I am confident that my skills and experience will be valuable in delivering robust and efficient solutions for your project.
